## Installation

The installation is quick and painless. There is a very small amount of time between deactivation of the original plugin and activation of the new plugin, however if you are concerned that it may conflict with users on your site, you can optionally place your site into maintenance mode -- instructions for which are beyond the scope of this file, but here's a [useful plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/maintenance/) that may help.

### Using the Dashboard

1. From the Plugins management page, find and download `LDD Directory Lite`. Don't activate it, and return to the Plugins page.
2. Deactivate `LDD Business Directory` from the Plugins page. Don't worry, you won't lose any data!
3. Activate `LDD Directory Lite`.
4. Last but not least, delete `LDD Business Directory` using the option on your Plugins page.
5. That's it.

### Via FTP

1. Download the `LDD Directory Lite` archive from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite) and uncompress it.
2. Connect to your site via FTP and navigate to the `wp-content/plugins` directory.
3. Upload `ldd-directory-lite/` to the same directory and delete `wp-content/plugins/ldd-business-directory`.
4. Navigate to your WordPress dashboard and you should receive a message that `LDD Business Directory` has been deactivated due to missing files.
5. From the Plugins management page, activate `LDD Directory Lite`.
