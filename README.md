> This is a fork of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/) plugin. Going forward the original plugin is considered unsupported and all active development will occur under the new name, LDD Directory Lite.

* **Working Version**: 0.5.3-beta
* **Latest Stable**: 
* **Contributors**: [@mwaterous](https://github.com/mwaterous)

LDD Directory Lite is a great way to add a powerful, feature rich and completely free custom directory to your WordPress web site.

Installation and configuration takes mere moments, and you can quickly start building a content rich directory of local businesses, restaurants, municipal services, non-profit organizations, or almost any other type of listing you can think of. Set your location, and build a completely local list of organizations or events, or leave it open and have an international directory.

Our Directory is extremely user friendly, ready to go almost straight out of the box. One of our primary focuses is on the user experience, and that includes both you as the site owner, and your visitors. Keeping with the progression of technology, we have ensured that all front end views generated by the plugin are 100% responsive and mobile ready; installing our plugin won't affect all the hard work you've put into ensuring your web site is usable on any medium!

### Here are just a few of the many features:

* Easy to install, easy to configure
* Add the `[directory]` shortcode to any page
* Customize the look and feel as much, or as little as you want
* Features can easily be enabled or disabled on the dashboard
* Fully customizable email notifications, for the admin and the user
* Focus on internationalization, this plugin works for everyone
* Clean, fully responsive interface
* Social media integration, build traffic for your users
* Google maps integration
* Live search, see your results as you type
* Powerful multi-part submission form

### Coming soon:

* User control panel, manage multiple listings and maintain full control over editing
* Premium modules, extend the capabilities of the Directory with features like import/export
* Shortcodes to display



## Installation

###### *You should always back up your data before making major changes to the way your production web site functions.*

Installation is easiest when done through your WordPress Dashboard:
Select the **Add New** option under your **Plugins** menu, type in *LDD Directory Lite* and install directly from the repository.

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps;

1. Download the latest stable version from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/)
2. Upload the archive contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** menu on your dashboard
4. Navigate to the **Directory Lite** menu option, and customize the settings to your needs
5. Insert the `[directory]` shortcode on to any page you want the directory to appear on (this can even be your home page).

If you have any questions or are unsure about any part of the process, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [WordPress.org Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ldd-directory-lite)

## Upgrading from LDD Business Directory

###### *You do not need to deactivate or uninstall the LDD Business Directory plugin before activating LDD Directory Lite.*

This plugin is a rewrite of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/). As such, you can upgrade to LDD Directory Lite from LDD Business Directory *without* losing any of your content.



1. Install and activate the plugin using the instructions [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/installation/).
2. The plugin will collect all your existing content and import it automatically.

As of now the plugin *does not* remove the data from the original Directory plugin. It also does not store any of its own data in the same locations, so the two datasets are completely separate.

While this does leave some clutter behind, it also ensures a painless upgrade path. Until the plugin has successfully been upgraded on a few hundred more sites, we chose not to remove your old data in case you either wanted to roll back to using the original plugin, or on the chance that something went awry with the beta.

A future version of LDD Directory Lite will scan for this leftover data and ask if you want to remove it.



### Using the Dashboard

1. From the Plugins management page, find and download `LDD Directory Lite`. Don't activate it, and return to the Plugins page.
2. Deactivate `LDD Business Directory` from the Plugins page. Don't worry, you won't lose any data!
3. Activate `LDD Directory Lite`.
4. Last but not least, delete `LDD Business Directory` using the option on your Plugins page.
5. That's it.

### Via FTP

1. Download the `LDD Directory Lite` archive from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite) and uncompress it.
2. Connect to your site via FTP and navigate to the `wp-content/plugins` directory.
3. Upload `ldd-directory-lite/` to the same directory and delete `wp-content/plugins/ldd-business-directory`.
4. Navigate to your WordPress dashboard and you should receive a message that `LDD Business Directory` has been deactivated due to missing files.
5. From the Plugins management page, activate `LDD Directory Lite`.

## Credits

I tend to spend a lot of time coding; not only is it my day job, but it's also one of the things I like to do in my spare time. No matter how much time I spend however, I'm just one person. This plugin is where it is thanks to the hard work and open source beliefs of more people than just myself. While I always try to make sure they are credited in the code itself, I would like to take the time to include them here as well. In no particular order:

**Who:** [WebDevStudios](http://webdevstudios.com/)<br>
**Where:** [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress)<br>
**Why:** Used to build the administrative user interface for the directory listings custom post types.

**Who:** Federico Ulfo<br>
**Where:** [Rain.TPL](http://www.raintpl.com/)<br>
**Why:** This amazing but lightweight template parser helps keep our views sorted away from our programming logic. It hasn't yet been decided whether or not this will be permanent (to capitalize on the caching abilities) or temporary (to run straight PHP templates for speed), it is an amazing parser that has helped me focus on other areas of programming.

**Who:** [yoast](https://yoast.com)<br>
**Where:** [WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/#wpseo) Usage Tracking<br>
**Why:** Code from the WordPress SEO plugin was integrated into this plugin in order to quickly add anonymous usage tracking. The information supplied by those who opt in to this program allows us a fantastic insight as to what configurations the plugin is being used on, and how to test future releases.

**Who:** [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) & [Bootflat](http://bootflat.github.io/)<br>
**Where:** Front end interface.<br>
**Why:** A trimmed down copy of bootstrap (which can be disabled if your theme already uses it) and bootflat were used to rapidly define the front end interface for the plugin. These libraries are amazing feats of CSS prowess.

**Who:** [Viljami S.](http://viljamis.com), [Henrik Joreteg, Adam Brault & Michael Garvin](http://happyjs.com/), [Ryan Heath](http://rpheath.com/)<br>
**Where:** [Responsive Slides](http://responsiveslides.com), [Happy.js](http://happyjs.com/), and [searchbox](https://github.com/rpheath/searchbox)<br>
**Why:** Various javascript elements all around the plugin are built on or with scripts originally coded by the above folk. As of this writing, my own javascript abilities are nowhere near as advanced as my ability to draw circles on my stomach and pat my head at the same time. Until they are, I seek out the knowledge of others.

**Who:** [Evan Solomon](http://evansolomon.me/), [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.ca), & [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)<br>
**Where:** [WP Github Flavored Markdown Comments](https://github.com/evansolomon/wp-github-flavored-markdown-comments/blob/master/github-flavored-markdown-comments.php)<br>
**Why:** Because markdown! Markdown is slowly being integrated in to the front end of the plugin, which will allow users to have some measure of control over the way their listings appear (should the site administrator choose to enable it).

**Who:** [Tim Schlechter](https://github.com/TimSchlechter)<br>
**Where:** [Bootstrap Tags Input](https://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/)<br>
**Why:** This was added initially on the dashboard to group multiple notification email addresses, but I can see it easily having a future on the front end of the plugin as well.

If I forgot anyone, it wasn't intentional and will be added to future updates of this file.
