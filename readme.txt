== Description ==

The LDD Business Directory plugin allows a user to easily import, manage, and display businesses and their information on a WordPress site. Simply use the shortcode [business_directory] on any wordpress page and the directory is displayed, allowing visitors to search through the directory and submit a listing of their own. If the user has a listing on the directory, they can easily sign in and edit their information. From the WordPress backend, it’s easy to categorize businesses and edit their information, as well as add any custom information fields that may be needed. Plus the settings allow for a greater range of customization of the functionality.
