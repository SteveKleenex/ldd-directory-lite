LDD Directory Lite allows you to add a powerful and fully integrated listing of local businesses or other organizations to your WordPress web site.

== Description ==

LDD Directory Lite is the best way to add a powerful, fully functional and free custom directory to your WordPress powered web site.

Within minutes you can install and configure LDD Directory Lite and start accepting submissions, or populating the content with your own listings. This is the best and easiest way to start any kind of directory you can think of, be it of local businesses (restaurants, coffee shops, craft stores, etc), or any other type of organization you would like to build around.

The Directory is extremely user friendly, ready to go pretty much out of the box. One of our primary focuses is ensuring that it integrates with almost any theme, anywhere, anytime, and we have utilized the power of Bootstrap to ensure that the Directory is 100% mobile ready and responsive. It won't break all that hard work you've put into making sure your site works on any medium.

We are also very developer friendly! LDD Directory Lite has another home on [GitHub](https://github.com/mwaterous/ldd-directory-lite), where you can get involved in making it even better.

== Installation ==

*You should always back up your data before making major changes to the way your production web site functions.*

Installation is easiest when done through your WordPress Dashboard:
Select the **Add New** option under your **Plugins** menu, type in *LDD Directory Lite* and install directly from the repository.

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps;

1. Download the latest stable version from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/)
2. Upload the archive contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** menu on your dashboard
4. Navigate to the **Directory Lite** menu option, and customize the settings to your needs
5. Insert the `[directory]` shortcode on to any page you want the directory to appear on (this can even be your home page).

If you have any questions or are unsure about any part of the process, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [WordPress.org Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ldd-directory-lite)

= Upgrading from LDD Business Directory =

This plugin is a rewrite of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/). As such, you can upgrade to LDD Directory Lite from LDD Business Directory *without* losing any of your content.

**You do not need to deactivate or uninstall the LDD Business Directory plugin before activating LDD Directory Lite.**


1. Install and activate the plugin using the instructions [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/installation/).
2. The plugin will collect all your existing content and import it automatically.

As of now the plugin *does not* remove the data from the original Directory plugin. It also does not store any of its own data in the same locations, so the two datasets are completely separate.

While this does leave some clutter behind, it also ensures a painless upgrade path. Until the plugin has successfully been upgraded on a few hundred more sites, we chose not to remove your old data in case you either wanted to roll back to using the original plugin, or on the chance that something went awry with the beta.

A future version of LDD Directory Lite will scan for this leftover data and ask if you want to remove it.


== Screenshots ==

1. We know some people love turning switches on and off, but we believe the most efficient use of your time is focusing on content. Configure everything once, and never worry about it again!
2. Whether all your content is user generated, or if it's entirely owner generated, there's an easy to use interface for adding, editing, or removing listings.
3. The directory is built to be fully responsive, so they integrate without any fuss and are 100% mobile ready.
4. Users can easily get in touch with organizations listed on your site, keeping them on your web site.
5. The submission process is broken down into multiple pages. Never-ending one page forms can be intimidating; we encourage your users to get involved by making it as painless as possible!
